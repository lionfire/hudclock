## The HudClock Experience

Imagine glancing at your screen and instantly knowing not just what time it is, but how your day is progressing. With a 24-hour analog clock, noon is at the top and midnight at the bottom ‚Äì you can literally see your entire day laid out before you. Or try metric time and experience a completely different rhythm to your day with 10 hours instead of 24.

For those who prefer subtlety, reduce the opacity until just a few semi-transparent elements float at the edge of your vision ‚Äì present when you need them, invisible when you don't.
